How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

WinMerge is great for highlighting the few places that changed and showing just 
those parts of the line that have changed making you focus on a very small area.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It is very easy to roll back numerous versions in one go rather than having to 
trawl multiple copies of the file.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

A git commit gives greater control over when to save your work but is only valid 
if you remember to do it. Conversely Google Docs saves just in case you forget 
but this creates a lot of overhead/files saves.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A Doc is an individual item that still reads well by itself but source files can 
be interrelated so just checking one file in can break the build


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will show me each commit and then git diff can be used to compare two commits
and display the things that changed in between.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You know you can always go back to a working version so you are free to experiment 
with the code and check it in for future reference.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

It is needed as part of my day job.
