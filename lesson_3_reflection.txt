When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Mainly for safe back up and also to release files to community


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You do not want the auto feature disrupting your work when you are part way
through fixing a bug or adding a new feature.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A fork can only be made on GitHub to copy someone else's repository into your account.
This is usually done when you don't have permission to change the original. Cloning
allows you to copy repositories locally and make changes there. Branches allow you
to make changes off the main line in a safe way with the option to merge back in again
only when you are happy with the changes.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You have a last known state and can collaborate with others, then later resolve 
conflicts as they occur.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

You would need a database somewhere of who is working on what and only allow one 
person to work in a given file at one time. This would be very time consuming
and result in tying people up in the merge process rather than working on the code.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

Branching allow you to experiment with code changes without breaking the master.
It also means you can collaborate with other then pick only those changes you want
on the master.
